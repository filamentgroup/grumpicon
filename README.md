### Running Locally

1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon-app`
2. Install Dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `grunt`
4. Create a virtual host to run from the root directory

You can also run Grunticon from the command line as part of a Grunt.js build process. More documentation is available on the [Grunticon task page](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/).

### Known Issues

- In Safari, the file you download is titled "Unknown." This can have ".zip" added to it and still function. This is because of Safari's lack of support for the download attribute on links (IE is also missing this attribute).
